# TODO: Add Date Range Selection for Chart Filtering

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Add getCampaignsByDate method in campaign.service.ts to fetch campaigns filtered by date range
- [x] Update welcome.component.ts to add dateRange property and onDateRangeChange method
- [x] Refactor ngOnInit to use loadData method for fetching data
- [x] Add p-calendar component in welcome.component.html for date range selection
- [x] Import FormsModule and CalendarModule in dashboard.module.ts
- [x] Add CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA to handle PrimeNG components

## Pending Tasks
- [ ] Test the date range filtering by running the Angular app and selecting date ranges
- [ ] Verify that charts update dynamically when date range is selected
- [ ] Ensure backend supports date filtering for campaigns (startDate and endDate query params)
- [ ] Add date filtering for contacts and templates if needed for other charts

## Notes
- Date range picker uses PrimeNG Calendar with range selection mode
- Charts will filter campaigns data based on selected date range
- Initial load shows all data, date range filters when selected
